# Lecture 1: getting started

## The course

This course will be a *24 hour* brief introduction to R, from the point of view of the *tidyverse*, a set of packages developed by Hadley Wickham.

We will be dealing with the basics of data handling:

- data input & output 
- data wrangling, selecting; filtering, mutating (with *dplyr*)
- data reshaping and merging (with *tidyr*)
- data plotting (with *ggplot*)
- tidy data analysis
- web crawling & scraping (with *rvest* and *RCrawler*)

Slides will be in English. **All** R documentation is in English. Out there you will be needing help, and it is good to be taught in the language you're going to get helped with. 

## Lecture plan: week 1

- **Lecture 1**: (tue 8th) setup, tools, workflow
- **Lecture 2**: (wed 9th) basic plotting
- **Lecture 3**: (thu 10th) data IO & basic data wrangiling
- **Lecture 4**: (fri 11th) advanced data wrangling

## Lecture plan: week 2

- **Lecture 5**: (tue 15th) tidy statistical analysis
- **Lecture 6**: (wed 16th) advanced plotting
- **Lecture 7**: (thu 17th) crawling data

## Assignment: week 4

In **Lecture 8** (wed sep 30th) each of you will present a **statistical report** on a topic of choice (list provided at the end of L7). 

This report will be

- done within an .Rmd file
- hosted on your gitHub page, on your repository
- a mixture of text, code, results and plots
